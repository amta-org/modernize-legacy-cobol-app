Title: As a user, I should see the rating of each book in the bookstore list
Description: A lot of the users have said that there's no clear way to distinguish the quality of the books in our portal. We should have a rating feature or something similar to that to allow users to quickly pick up most highest rated books from the other users. The rating of each book is from 1 to 5 stars.
